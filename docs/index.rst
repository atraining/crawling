A simple example

You can see a `basic version <http://golem.ericholscher.com/kong/>`_ running for my personal site. It is super barebones, but it should give you an idea of what exactly is possible.

Tests are written using  `Twill <http://twill.idyll.org/commands.html>`_, which allows for easy functional testing of web apps.
